# Hello World!

I’m **Pushkar**, a developer who likes building things that actually *do* something.
I’m currently focused on **Flutter Application Development**, **DSA**, and gradually moving towards **FastAPI backend + ML-Powered Systems**.
If an idea makes sense and excites me, chances are I’ll try to build it.

### Tech I Work With
- **Flutter / Dart**
- **REST APIs (learning FastAPI)**
- **Firebase**
- **PostgreSQL**
- **Basic ML (MLP, SVM, Random Forests)**
- 
---

### What I’m Building
- Cross-platform Flutter apps  
- College & real-life problem–solving projects  
- Systems that combine **Frontend + Backend + Intelligence**
  
---

### Currently Learning
- Advanced Flutter architecture (Riverpod / Clean / MVVM)
- Backend with FastAPI
- Practical Machine Learning (beyond just algorithms)

### Fun Facts
- I prefer **building** over just watching tutorials  
- Anime + reading + coding keeps me sane  
- I like projects that are slightly complex and challenge my thinking
