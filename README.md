### Hello World!

I’m **Pushkar Jadhav**, a developer who likes building things that actually *do* something.  
I’m currently focused on **Flutter Application Development**, **DSA**, and gradually moving towards **FastAPI backend + ML-powered systems**.

If an idea makes sense and excites me, chances are I’ll try to build it.
