# Hey there 👋

I’m **Pushkar**, a developer who likes building things that actually *do* something.
I’m currently focused on **Flutter Application Development**, **DSA**, and gradually moving towards **FastAPI backend + ML-Powered Systems**.
If an idea makes sense and excites me, chances are I’ll try to build it.

### ⚙️ Tech I Work With
- **Flutter / Dart**
- **REST APIs (learning FastAPI)**
- **Firebase**
